Let me tell you about mv best friend. His name is Yuriy. We have known each other for ages. We live in the same town and went to the same school. Now we study at the same university And though we study at different faculties, we see each other almost every day. My best friend is the first to come and support me in any difficult situation. We have a lot in common. We both do sports regularly. That's because we want to be strong and look handsome. We really look very much alike. We have short dark hair, grey eyes and a sport figure. We also have many similar features of character: we are merry, smart and active.
