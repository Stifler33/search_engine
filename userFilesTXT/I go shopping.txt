My name is Dima. I am a student of the second year of study. I study at the university. My hobby is music. When I have free time I usually go to the biggest music shop in my town and buy CDs with my favourite music.
I have a big collection of CDs at home, but I can not resist the temptation of buying a new CD. That what I like to buy most of all.
